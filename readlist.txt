(1)Anthropometric and human gait identification using skeleton data from kinect sensor
(2)bio-inspired predictive orientation decomposition of skeleton trajectories for real-time human activity prediction
(3)DL-GSGC(this is a short-cut)
(4)human action recognition by representing 3d skeleton as point in a lie group
(5)robust estimation of 3d human poses from a single image
(6)structured streaming skeleton a new feature for online human gesture recognition
